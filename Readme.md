This is a project is essentially an Esty-clone where sellers can display and sell their handmade creations for customers to buy.  Sellers can add, update and delete products as they see fit and look at a dashboard to see information about theirself and their overall average rating across all their products.  Additionally, customers can browse the creations, purchase items, and leave simple reviews that they see.
